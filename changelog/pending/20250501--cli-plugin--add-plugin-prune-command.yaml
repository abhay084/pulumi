  Added a new `pulumi plugin prune` command that removes older versions of plugins while keeping the most recent versions. 
  By default, this command keeps the latest version of each plugin for each major version. The command also supports a mode for 
  keeping only the latest version regardless of major version (--latest-only). This helps reclaim disk space from old plugin 
  versions that are no longer needed.
